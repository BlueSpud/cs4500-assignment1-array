For this project we decided to implement an Array.
Drawing on a lot of the code we used for Warmup3, the focus was on building a versatile Array class. 
We did hit one snag on the implementation of making a data structure that can hold a collection of either objects or strings. 
While it would have been really cool to have a base object array and the string array inherits from 
itâ€¦instead both types of array inherit from the Object class with a small amount of code duplication due 
to them requiring specifically typed underlying data structures. 
If we were to expand this project for more data types and turn it into a deliverable our CwC company could use 
in production - this would be the first area we would look to improve in our design.
